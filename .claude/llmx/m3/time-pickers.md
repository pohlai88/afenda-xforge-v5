## Color
Color values are implemented through design tokens. For design, this means working with color values that correspond with tokens. For implementation, a color value will be a token that references a value. [Learn more about design tokens](/m3/pages/design-tokens/overview)

## §Guidelines

## Usage
Time pickers allow people to enter a specific time value. They’re displayed in dialogs and can be used to select hours, minutes, or periods of time.
They can be used for a wide range of scenarios. Common use cases include:
- Setting an alarm
- Scheduling a meeting
Time pickers are not ideal for nuanced or granular time selection, such as milliseconds for a stopwatch application.

### Time input picker
Time input pickers allow people to specify a time using keyboard numbers. This input option should be accessible from any other mobile time picker interface by tapping the keyboard icon.

### 24-hour time selection
The dial view can be changed to reflect time selection across 24 hours. This option is set outside of the time picker component, typically through system settings.

### Container
Like dialogs, the container should appear above other screen elements. To focus attention, surfaces behind the container have a temporary scrim overlay to make them less prominent.

_The container includes all time picker elements_
### Input selector
The input selector is a unique kind of text field input. It differs from typical text field inputs in that it has:
- An added highlight to call attention to the selected field

- A larger shape, size, and font

- A label below the field

Hours and minutes should have separate inputs. For people using a 12-hour clock, an AM/PM selector appears to the right of minutes. For people using a 24-hour clock, the AM/PM selector shouldn’t appear.

_Input selector for a 12-hour clock_
### Dial selector
Dial selectors always mimic a round watch face. Hours and minutes can be selected by tapping a number or dragging the dial selector track.
When representing a 12-hour dial, all numbers appear in the outer ring. When representing a 24-hour dial, even numbers appear in an inner ring, and odd numbers appear in an outer ring.

### Text & icon buttons
Icon buttons are used to switch between the input selector, represented by a keyboard, and the dial selector, represented by a clock.
Text buttons are used to exit the dialog (**Cancel**) and save the selector input (**OK**).
![image] Time picker buttons.
_The keyboard icon allows people to switch between the dial selector (pictured) and the input selector_
### Landscape orientation
The clock dial interface adapts to a device’s orientation. In landscape mode, the stacked input and selection options are positioned side-by-side.

_On mobile, the time picker can adapt to landscape orientation_
## Placement
Time pickers shouldn’t be obscured by other elements.  
Time pickers should change orientation or variant to ensure they aren't cropped by the edge of the screen.

Time pickers are modal windows above a scrim. This puts the time pickers at the forefront of a person's view, calling attention to make a selection of time.
![image] Input time picker in landscape orientation on mobile. It's fully visible despite the limited device height.
_The time picker should change to fit the size of the screen so the time picker is always fully visible_
## Adaptive design
Time pickers can swap between orientation or variant depending on device orientation and viewport constraints. 
For example, the time picker can change to landscape orientation on larger breakpoints or when viewport height is limited, to avoid scrolling the dial presentation. 
Time pickers can fallback to the input time picker when there isn’t enough vertical real estate to present the landscape orientation without scrolling.

### Density
Don’t apply density to the time picker dial when the viewport is constrained. Instead, use an input picker.
![image] Dial time picker in portrait orientation, too tall to fully fit on a mobile device in landscape mode.
_Don’t apply density to the time picker dial when the viewport is constrained. Instead, use an input picker._
## Behavior
There are two primary methods for selecting time with the mobile time picker. People can:
- Type in a specific value in the hour and minute fields
- Select the hour or minute field from the text input and adjust the clock dial to simultaneously change the corresponding time field above
![image] Dial time picker possible interactions. Dial selector adjusts to match manual input.
_The dial time picker supports both manual and dial input_
### Appearing & disappearing
Like other kinds of dialogs, time pickers use an enter and exit transition pattern to appear on the screen.
To exit a time picker, the input can either be confirmed (**OK**) or dismissed (**Cancel**). Interacting outside of the dialog will also dismiss the time picker. Unless one of these actions is taken, a time picker will continue to retain focus.
![image] Time picker enter and exit transitions.
_OK** confirms the entry and closes the dialog_
### Toggle between dial & input
Tapping the keyboard icon on a mobile time picker switches the view to the input picker.
![image] Time picker transitioning between dial and input selectors.
_The keyboard icon in the lower left toggles between the input picker and the dial picker_
### Scrolling
Time pickers should avoid scrolling, and swap component orientation or variant based on device orientation or viewport size. 
Time pickers don’t scroll with elements outside of the modal window, such as the background.

## §Accessibility

## Use cases
People should be able to use assistive technology to: 
- Select or enter hours/minutes, and in some cases, seconds/milliseconds
- Choose from multiple time formats, including 24-hour clock view and AM/PM
- Enter time selection manually using input fields
## Interaction & style
Time pickers should allow manual time entry through text input, rather than exclusively through the dial selector. This makes it easier for those using keyboard inputs rather than touchscreens. 
If a screen is not large enough to display the dial selector, consider displaying the input selector alone. Currently for Android Views, the dial selector is always visible.
The input selector should be accessible from the dial selector via the keyboard icon. This interaction allows multiple input methods and makes the time picker accessible for assistive technology users.

_For time selection that doesn’t require a dial view, make a time input picker the default option_
### Targets
Targets for dial selectors should be 48x48dp.

## Keyboard navigation
| | Keys | Actions
| **Tab** | Focus lands on (non-disabled) time slot
| **Space** or **Enter**
 | Activates the (non-disabled) time slot
## Labeling elements
If the input text is correctly linked, assistive tech like a screenreader will read the component’s role first, then the UI text.
