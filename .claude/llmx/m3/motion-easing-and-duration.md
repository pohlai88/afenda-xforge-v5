## §Applying easing and duration

star
Note:
In the expressive update, components and motion now use the [motion physics system](/m3/pages/motion-overview/), which uses springs. Products should migrate to the new system. The easing and duration system is still used for transitions and can be used by teams that haven't yet updated to GM3 Expressive, but is no longer maintained.
## Suggested easing and duration pairs
Choosing the right combination of easing and duration can be complicated. As a simple starting point, these are sensible defaults that will work for most transitions.
| **Easing**  | **Duration** | **Transition type**
| Emphasized | 500ms | Begin and end on screen
| Emphasized decelerate | 400ms | Enter the screen
| Emphasized accelerate | 200ms | Exit the screen
| Standard | 300ms | Begin and end on screen
| Standard decelerate | 250ms | Enter the screen
| Standard accelerate
 | 200ms | Exit the screen
## Easing
In the physical world, objects don’t start or stop instantaneously. Instead, they take time to speed up and slow down. Transitions without easing look stiff and mechanical, while a transition with easing appears more natural.

Compared to the utilitarian style of M2, M3 easing is more expressive. Transitions have snappy take offs and very soft landings. 
Durations are slightly longer compared to M2. This gives transitions time to come to a gentle rest without feeling abrupt.

### Choosing an easing set
The [**Emphasized easing set**](/m3/pages/motion-easing-and-duration/tokens-specs#cbea5c6e-7b0d-47a0-98c3-767080a38d95) is recommended for most transitions to capture the style of M3.
The [**Standard easing set**](/m3/pages/motion-easing-and-duration/tokens-specs#601d5552-a6e6-4d74-9886-ff8f24b9ec35) can be used for small utility focused transitions that need to be quick. The Standard set is also a fallback for platforms that don't support Emphasized easing, like iOS and Web.

_Standard easing is used for this Text field transition on Web. The simple style fits the utility of this component._
### Choosing an easing type
Easing types are chosen based on how a transition moves in relation to the screen.
#### Begin and end on screen
These transitions use Emphasized** easing. It speeds up quickly and then comes to a gentle rest in order to emphasize the end of the transition.
![image] Card expanding in a podcast app.
_This transition begins and ends on screen so it uses Emphasized easing_
#### Enter the screen
These transitions use Emphasized decelerate** easing. It begins at peak velocity then comes to a gentle rest.

#### Exit the screen permanently
These transitions use Emphasized accelerate** easing. It begins at rest and ends at peak velocity. By ending at peak velocity, it gives the impression the exiting component cannot be retrieved.

#### Exit the screen temporarily
These transitions use **Emphasized** easing. By ending at rest just off screen, it gives the impression the exiting component can be retrieved.

## Duration
Transitions shouldn’t be jarringly fast or so slow that users feel as though they’re waiting. The right combination of duration and easing produces smooth and responsive transitions.

_A transition with a well tuned duration is quick and easy to follow_
![image] Clock icon is expanded rapidly, in abrupt fashion, to take over the screen.
_Avoid transitions with such a short duration they become jarring_
### Choosing a duration
Durations are chosen based on these criteria:
#### Transition size
Transitions that cover small areas of the screen have short durations. Those that traverse large areas have long durations. Scaling duration with the size of a transition area gives a consistent sense of speed.
![image] A series of radio buttons are selected on the Settings screen.
_This transition covers a small area with a short 200ms duration_
![image] An album is selected that takes over the screen.
_This transition covers a large area with a long 500ms duration_
#### Enter vs. exit transitions
Transitions that exit, dismiss, or collapse an element use shorter durations. Exit transitions are faster because they require less attention than the user’s next task.
Transitions that enter or remain persistent on the screen use longer durations. This helps users focus attention on what's new on screen.
![image] Pop up screen on an email draft has option to delete or cancel.
_- An Enter transition has a long duration of 500ms 
- An Exit transition has a short duration of 200ms_
![image] Bottom sheet uses a longer animation duration to enter and a shorter duration to exit the screen.

## Easing
### Emphasized easing set
This set is the most common because it captures the expressive style of M3.
