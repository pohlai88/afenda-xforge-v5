## §Baseline

**Baseline** is the default static color scheme. It uses accessible color pairings and includes colors for both light and dark themes.

## Design with baseline
### Use the Design Kit and M3 baseline colors in new design files
- Create your Figma file. Enable the [M3 Design Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460) in your Assets panel.

- Compose screens and layouts using Material Components from the design kit

- Apply M3 baseline color roles to custom components and UI elements by hovering on the element's color property in the Design panel on the right of the screen and selecting the **Style** icon (four dots). This opens a selection dialog.

- Search for "M3" to see the baseline color roles

- Select the baseline color role that most closely matches the use case and intent (see [Color roles](/m3/pages/color-roles) for more information on what color to use where)

- Repeat until all custom elements are using M3 baseline color roles

### Apply baseline colors to an existing file
**First, get the M3 baseline colors into your file**
- Open your Figma design file. Select the **Actions** menu (or Ctrl/Command+K).

- Find the [Material Theme Builder plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/material-theme-builder) and select **Run**. This will open a plugin dialog showing the default color scheme, including Core colors and Extended colors.

- Open the plugin's **Settings** (gear icon at lower right of dialog) and select the checkbox for **Generate State Layers**. This makes sure there are color for the state layers needed to design interactions. [Learn more about state layers](/m3/pages/interaction-states/state-layers)

- Navigate out of settings.

- With the Current Theme dropdown at the top of the dialog, select **Baseline.**

- Select the frames or components in your file and then hit **Swap** in the bottom right of the dialog. This will automatically update the colors for any M3 Design Kit components.

**Then, update any remaining non-M3 color styles**
- Manually change any hex values or non-M3 color styles by selecting all and looking through the Selection colors in the Design panel on the right of the screen.

- Any colors that don't start with "M3" need to be replaced with a corresponding baseline color.

- Hover on a non-M3 color row in the Design panel and select the **Style** icon (four dots). This opens a selection dialog.

- Search for "M3" to see the baseline color roles.

- Select the baseline color role that most closely matches that color's use case (see [Color roles](/m3/pages/color-roles) for more information on what color to use where) and select **Use style** to apply it to the selected objects.

- Repeat until all non-M3 colors in the file have been replaced with M3 baseline color roles.

## §Custom brand

In a brand-based static scheme, the colors are hand-picked by your team to align with your product's brand color. Brand-based schemes are entirely created and maintained by your team, so this approach requires a larger investment of time and effort.
**With a brand color scheme, end-users see**
- An accessible UI with static colors
- A product that "looks like its brand"

_This example meditation app uses a static scheme created from its brand colors._
## Create a custom brand color scheme
- Open your Figma design file. Select the **Actions** menu (or Ctrl/Command+K).

- Find the [Material Theme Builder plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/material-theme-builder) and select **Run**. This will open a plugin dialog showing the default color scheme, including Core colors and Extended colors.

- Open the plugin's **Settings** (gear icon at lower right of dialog) and select the checkboxes for both **New theme color diagram** and **Generate State Layers**. This will create a handy visualization of your branded color scheme and also generate state layers essential for designing interactions. [Learn more about state layers](/m3/pages/interaction-states/state-layers)

- Navigate out of settings.

- Open the Current Theme dropdown at the top of the dialog and select **+ ADD NEW THEME.**

- Give your theme a short name (this name will become the prefix of your color roles in Figma).

- Select **ADD THEME.**

- With **Custom** selected, select **Primary**. This opens a dialog prompting you to select a custom source color.

- Enter the Hex value for your brand color and hit **Apply**.

This will generate a full custom color scheme. You can use the scheme as-is or repeat steps 5 and 6 to set custom sources for the Secondary, Tertiary, Error, Neutral, and Neutral Variant colors.
