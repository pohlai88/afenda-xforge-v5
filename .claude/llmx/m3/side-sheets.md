## Standard side sheet

### Standard side sheet color
Color values are implemented through design tokens. For design, this means working with color values that correspond with tokens. For implementation, a color value will be a token that references a value. [Learn more about design tokens](/m3/pages/design-tokens/overview/)

## §Guidelines

_- Standard side sheet

## Usage
Standard side sheets are supplementary surfaces used mostly in medium to expanded breakpoints, like tablet and desktop. They provide a consistent and predictable surface for contextual actions and information.

Standard side sheets display content that complements the screen’s primary content. They remain visible while people interact with primary content.
Common uses include:
- Displaying a list of actions that affect the screen’s primary content, such as filters

- Displaying supplemental content and features
![image] Standard side sheet showing supplementary information about a photo.
_Information about a photo in a standard side sheet_
Modal side sheets are preferred in compact breakpoints, like mobile, due to limited screen size. 
They can display the same kinds of content as standard side sheets, but must be dismissed in order to interact with the underlying content.
![image] Modal side sheet showing filter controls.
_Modal side sheet with filter controls_
Side sheets have a fixed width and typically span the height of the screen. 
Their dimensions depend on how the app’s layout is subdivided into UI regions.
![image] A modal sheet at the right of a screen, with the correct inset.
_Place side sheets along the edge of the screen, usually on the right side to avoid interference with any navigational components on the left edge. They can be slightly inset by 16dp._

_Don’t inset a side sheet from the screen edges far beyond the recommended margin. This makes the sheet’s position and scroll behavior unclear, while obscuring primary content._

### Container
Side sheet containers hold all side sheet elements. Their size is determined by the space those elements occupy.
 
The container is the only required element of a side sheet.

### Back icon button (optional)
Icon buttons can provide ways to exit a side sheet or move to a different experience.

Because the primary content behind or beside a side sheet is always visible, it’s important to provide affordances for leaving a side sheet and returning to the primary content.

### Close icon button (optional)
A close affordance provides a consistent method for dismissing a side sheet. 
A close icon button is highly recommended, increases accessibility, and makes focused side sheets easier to close.

### Action buttons (optional)
Buttons represent actions available from a side sheet. Examples: **Save**, **Edit**, **Download**
Use elevation, fill, and tone to call attention to specific actions.

_- Action buttons_
### Divider (optional)
Dividers can separate different kinds of content and create distinct regions in a side sheet. 

Use a divider to separate:
- Action buttons from content

- User-generated content from system-generated content

### Content (optional)
Side sheets can display a wide variety of content and layouts, ranging from a list of actions to supplemental content in a tabular layout.

![image] As a small screen changes to a larger size the modal side sheet transitions to a standard side sheet.
_Modal side sheets on smaller screens can transition to standard side sheets at larger screen sizes_
## Adaptive design
Side sheets have a default width, but can be resized depending on the needs of the layout. 

When a standard side sheet opens, the body area shrinks to accommodate the sheet’s width while maintaining a margin on the body’s trailing edge.

_Entrance of standard side sheets will cause the body area to adjust and accommodate the new content_
### RTL language support
In right-to-left (RTL) languages, side sheets should appear on the left edge of the window with all elements reversed.

## Behavior
Side sheets can vertically scroll independent of the rest of the UI. 
This allows their scroll position and content to persist while the page is scrolled, and vice versa.
Side sheets cannot scroll horizontally.
![image] Animation showing a side sheet being scrolled vertically to view all the options.
_Side sheets can vertically scroll internally when their content exceeds the screen height_
![image] A side sheet appears to scroll horizontally.
_Don’t allow horizontal scrolling or lay out the side sheet in a way that suggests horizontal scrolling. A side sheet’s narrow width leaves limited space to fully view items._
### Predictive back
On Android, a gesture called [predictive back](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/docs/foundations/PredictiveBack.md) allows a person to swipe left or right on the side sheet. 
When predictive back is used:
- The side sheet detaches from the top and bottom edges of the screen to signal it will close

- The previous screen is revealed in a preview

- The side sheet and its content always scales in the direction of the gesture

## §Accessibility

## Use cases
People should be able to dismiss the side sheet using assistive technology.
## Interaction & style
Material requires that a close affordance, such as a close icon button, is always present within a side sheet.

_Without a close icon button, people can’t predict the opening and closing flow of side sheets, or know if the sheet is transient or permanent_
## Initial focus
Actions within a side sheet can be focused by tab order using a keyboard or switch control.

- Headline

## Keyboard navigation
