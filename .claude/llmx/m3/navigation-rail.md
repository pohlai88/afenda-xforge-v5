## §Guidelines

![image] Colorful, purple navigation rail shown collapsed and expanded.
_Use the menu icon to transition between collapsed and expanded navigation rails_
## Usage
The navigation rail can display navigation items, a menu, and a floating action button (FAB) in a vertical orientation.
There are two variants of navigation rails, **collapsed** and **expanded**, which can easily transform into each other when the menu button is selected.

### Collapsed
The **collapsed** nav rail runs along the leading edge of the window, and should contain 3–7 navigation items. It should not be hidden.
It can be used in medium to extra large breakpoints, such as tablets and desktop. In  medium windows with few destinations, consider using a navigation bar instead. Compact windows should always use a navigation bar.
![image] Collapsed navigation rail with “timer” icon on FAB.
_A navigation rail should be the only visible navigation element_
### Expanded
The **expanded** navigation rail can be standard or modal, and should always open from a menu icon. An expanded rail can reveal secondary destinations not visible when collapsed.

The **standard** configuration is placed beside body content. It’s best for larger windows with lots of available space.

The **modal** configuration overlaps the body content, and should be opened from a menu icon. Use the modal configuration for:
- Information dense layouts where space is limited
- Products with many navigation items
![image] Expanded navigation rail shown expanded by default and expanded over screen content.
_A navigation rail can be expanded by default on larger screen sizes, or can be expanded over content on smaller screen sizes_
In immersive experiences, the expanded navigation rail can be hidden entirely, appearing only when the menu icon is selected.

The collapsed navigation rail should not be hidden.
![image] Navigation rail and hidden navigation rail with menu icon button for expansion.
_The expanded navigation rail can also be hidden, appearing only when the menu icon is selected_
## Anatomy

_- Container
- Menu (optional)

- Floating action button (FAB) (optional)

- Icon - active

- Label text - active

- Active indicator

- Icon - inactive

- Large badge (optional)

- Large badge label

- Small badge

- Label text - inactive_
### Container
The navigation rail should be placed on the leading edge of the window. This is the left side for left-to-right languages, and the right side for right-to-left languages.

The container fill can be turned off so the nav rail appears directly on the surface. When doing this, make sure all items have a minimum of 3:1 color contrast.
![image] Right-to-left navigation rail in Hebrew, and left-to-right navigation rail in English.
_The navigation rail should be placed on the leading edge of the window_
The navigation rail should always run vertically along the side of a layout. Don’t make it horizontal.

Use a navigation bar for horizontal navigation.
![image] Horizontal navigation rail on timer screen.
_Don’t use the navigation rail horizontally. Use a navigation bar instead._
Navigation rail items can be aligned as a group to the top or center of a layout. On tablets, use center alignment to make it easier to reach items.

The menu icon and FAB should always be top-aligned.
![image] Navigation rails with different alignments.
_Top and center aligned rail destination placement_
### Menu (optional)
The menu button can transition between the **collapsed **and **expanded** navigation rails.

Once expanded, the rail can reveal secondary destinations.

When the navigation rail is expanded, the menu icon should change to represent that it can be collapsed.
![image] Expanded and collapsed navigation rails controlled by a menu icon button.
_A navigation rail can expand to reveal more destinations_
### Floating action button (FAB) (optional)
The container of the navigation rail is ideal for anchoring the FAB to the top of a screen, placing the app’s key action above navigation destinations.

When nested within another component, such as the navigation rail, the FAB's resting elevation should be [level 0](/m3/pages/elevation/applying-elevation).
![image] Navigation rail with a FAB button at the top of the screen.
_A top-aligned FAB in the navigation rail_
![image] Navigation rail with a FAB button at the bottom of the screen.
_Avoid placing the FAB below navigation items_
The top of the rail can also be used for a logo, however avoid using logos that could be mistaken as buttons.

Don’t use a logo as a menu button to expand the navigation rail.
![image] Navigation rail with Material design logo at the top of the screen.
_Use caution when placing logos in the rail where they might be confused with an action or destination_
### Active indicator
The active indicator shows which page is being displayed.
![image] Navigation rail with active indicators present for the current screen.
_Use the active indicator only for the current open page_
![image] Navigation rail with active indicators present for all navigation items.
_Don’t use the active indicator for more than one navigation item at a time_
The active indicator hugs the label text in the expanded nav rail. To achieve a similar style to the baseline navigation drawer, consider modifying the active indicator to fill the container.

The target area should always span the full width.

_The active indicator hugs contents in the expanded nav rail_
![image] Navigation rail with active indicator that is larger than the content within it.
_Override the indicator to fill the container to more closely resemble the baseline navigation drawer_
### Icons
Navigation rail items must use icons that symbolize the content of their page. Browse popular icons on [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com/icons).
![image] Navigation rail with icons that fit the destinations, like a timer icon and label leading to a timer feature.
_Icons should symbolize the content of the page they open_
When a destination is selected, the icon fills and changes color. An active indicator appears behind the icon.
![image] Icons with and without an active indicator.
_Selected navigation items have an active indicator, a filled icon, and a more prominent color_
### Label text
The label text should be a short, meaningful description of each navigation destination and another way for users to understand an icon’s meaning.

All navigation items require a one word label text.
![image] Navigation rail with clear text labels.
_Write clear and concise labels that describe the destination page_
Avoid wrapping long labels when possible. If necessary, create a line break between words, or hyphenate longer words.
![image] Navigation rail with lengthy text labels.
_Break up longer phrases into two text lines if necessary_
Labels should be short enough to not be truncated. Don’t shrink the type scale to fit longer text labels.
![image] Navigation rail with truncated text label with ellipses.
_Don’t truncate or display an ellipsis in place of label text_
![image] Navigation rail with small text label.
_Don’t reduce the type size to fit more characters into a destination label_
### Badges
Navigation rail icons can include badges to communicate dynamic information about the  destination, such as counts or status.

In compact nav rails, the badge is placed in the upper right corner of the icon. In expanded nav rails, the badge should be placed next to the label text.
![image] Navigation rail with badges on each icon.
_1. Small badge on a rail destination 
2. Large badge with a number
3. Large badge with a maximum character count_
### Divider (optional)
A vertical divider can help separate the rail from app content. The divider should be positioned on the edge of the rail container that’s adjacent to the app’s content area.
![image] Navigation rail with divider separating it from screen content.
_A divider can make the navigation rail container distinct from other on-screen content_
## Placement
In adaptive layouts, the navigation rail should be placed outside any panes, always along the leading edge of the window. Don’t place it within body content.

When the navigation rail is hidden, the body content can fill in the remaining space as long as the menu icon is still accessible.

Tabs can be used alongside a navigation rail to create an extra layer of visible navigation.

_Expanded navigation rails can open from menu buttons on mobile_
## Adaptive design
For more, see [adaptive design](/m3/pages/layout-overview/adaptive-design/).
### Resizing
When moving from a large screen to a small screen, a navigation rail can transform into a navigation bar, providing the same quick access in a configuration that’s easier to use on smaller displays. Never use the navigation rail and navigation bar simultaneously. 
Only use navigation rails for medium breakpoints and larger. Don’t use a navigation bar. If there are more than five destinations, consider using a modal expanded nav rail instead.
**Compact:** Don’t use a standard navigation rail for compact layouts due to space constraints. Use a navigation bar instead.
**Medium:** Use a navigation rail, especially if prioritizing persistent vertical navigation over maximizing vertical content space.
**Expanded to extra-large:** Use a navigation rail, not a navigation bar. Consider available horizontal space and the number of destinations when choosing between standard and modal.
![image] Navigation bar on a phone screen and navigation rail on a tablet screen.
_On smaller devices, use a navigation bar. On larger displays, use a navigation rail._
### Presentation
When the navigation rail transitions from collapsed to expanded, the contents of the page should automatically adjust to fit.

The contents of the navigation rail also expand to fill the space. For example, the FAB should transition into an extended FAB. 

Extra destinations can be shown in an expanded nav rail.
![image] Extra destinations in an expanded navigation rail.
_Use a standard expanded rail when there are secondary destinations or actions that have lower priority than the main navigation items_
## Behavior
### Scrolling
Destinations in the navigation rail should remain visible and fixed when scrolling vertically.
![image] Screen content scrolls while rails stay fixed.
_Rail destinations remain fixed while on-screen content scrolls vertically_
If a layout scrolls horizontally, the rail can scroll off-screen or remain fixed. To distinguish that content is scrolling underneath the rail, use a divider or add elevation to the rail.
![image] A nav rail with a divider between it and the page’s content.
_A divider and color fill change create visual distinction between the rail and horizontally scrolling content_
![image] A nav rail with slight elevation.
_Elevating the rail to level 1 creates visual distinction between the rail and horizontally scrolling content_
### Selection
When a destination is tapped, the destination screen uses a [top level](/m3/pages/motion-transitions/transition-patterns#f852afd2-396f-49fd-a265-5f6d96680e16) transition pattern. In addition, the icon becomes filled and the active indicator expands from the center of the icon.
![image] Selection transition between one navigation item and another.
_Tapping a destination uses a top level transition pattern_
### Back
On Android, a gesture called predictive back allows people to swipe left or right on the screen to go back or dismiss modal components.

- Previous screen is revealed in a preview to signal the destination

- Predictive back only applies to the **modal expanded** navigation rail.
A list of compatible components is available on the [gestures page](/m3/pages/gestures/).
![image] Modal expanded navigation rail with Android predictive back feature.
_The nav rail pops off the edge of the window during the predictive back gesture_

## §Accessibility

## Use cases
People should be able to do the following using the assistive technology:
- Navigate between navigation destinations
- Select a particular navigation destination from a set
- Get appropriate feedback based on input type
## Interaction & style
When a navigation item is tapped, the active indicator appears, providing the following feedback to the user that it is selected:
- A ripple passes through the indicator
- The icon switches from outlined to filled
- The icon and text change color
When hovered, the hover state appears, providing a visual cue that the destination is interactive.
![image] Colorful, purple navigation rail shown collapsed and expanded.
_Touch: Tap_
![image] Tap indicator on a collapsed nav rail.
_Cursor: Hover, Click_
The target area for expanded navigation rails spans the full width of the container, even though the active indicator visually hugs the content.
![image] Touch indicator on a nav rail.
_Touch: Tap_
Use a filled icon for the active destination and outlined icons for inactive destinations.

Active and inactive icon colors need sufficient contrast against the container.
![image] Navigation rail with filled element.
_Use the default color scheme to ensure proper contrast and emphasis on the active destination_
![image] Nav rail with multiple navigation destinations and multi-colored contrast.
_Don’t use more than two colors for destinations or low-contrast colors in the navigation rail. This will make distinguishing active items difficult._
If an icon doesn’t have a filled style, use the semibold icon weight instead.
![image] Icon button with semibold weight, without filled options.
_An icon with no filled option should use the semibold weight when active_
### Text scaling and truncation
When someone sets their device to show a larger text size, the navigation rail items should grow vertically to accommodate larger labels while retaining the default padding. It’s okay for scaled text to wrap in navigation items.
To remain accessible, ensure the full label is always visible on-screen at up to 2x text sizing. Beyond this size, text can truncate.
![image] Nav rail with text scaled to 1.5x size. All labels are on one line.
_Text scaled to 1.5 size_
![image] Nav rail with text scaled to 2x size. Some labels wrap to two lines.
_Text scaled to 2x size_
### Initial focus
Initial focus lands directly on the first interactive item, whether it’s the menu, the FAB, or the first navigation item.

From the FAB or menu, **Tab** brings the person to the navigation items. **Tab** or **Arrows** then navigate between items.
![image] Arrows help people move between pages.
_Use arrows to move between navigation items_
![image] Space/enter help people choose a navigation destination.
_Use space/enter to activate the focused navigation item_
### Visual indicators
Icons give the dominant cue of the navigation state. Use a filled icon for the selected destination to contrast with outlined icons for the non-selected destinations.
![image] Nav bar with an active, filled icon button.
_Use a filled icon variant on the selected navigation item to differentiate from inactive navigation items_
![image] Selected navigation item without filled icon style.
_Avoid using the same unfilled icon style for both selected and unselected items because it lacks important visual feedback cue_
## Keyboard navigation
| | Keys | Actions
| Tab / Arrows | Navigate between interactive elements
| Space / Enter
 | Selects an interactive element
## Labeling elements
The accessibility label for a navigation item is typically the same as the adjacent text label.

When the visible UI text is ambiguous, accessibility labels need to be more descriptive. For example, a navigation item visibly labeled **Recent** would benefit from additional information in its accessibility label to clarify the destination's intent.

Note: On Android Views (MDC-Android), a more descriptive accessibility label is not available and the role is not announced.
![image] “Maps” is both the icon label text and the accessibility label.
_While the visible label text reads **Recent**, the accessibility label for this switch clarifies its function: **Recent images**_
