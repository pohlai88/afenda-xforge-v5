## Configurations
### Style
Search comes in two styles:
- Contained: Has an expressive look and feel. It uses a filled container to separate a search bar from a list of suggestions or results

- Divided (baseline): Doesn’t have the latest visual style, motion, or flexibility

_The contained style has a persistent, filled container, expressive motion, and rounded shape_
![image] An email inbox search bar in a divided style.
_The divided (baseline) style uses a divider to separate the search bar from suggestions and results_
### Layout
Search suggestions and results appear in customizable lists, with two layout options: full-screen and docked. [More on search layouts](/m3/pages/search/guidelines#4f6c921c-795f-4e06-9b12-27ae7d502adb)

```json
{"contextTags":["None","Medium contrast","Default","High contrast","Static","Compose","3P","Web","Android","Dark","Light"],"hideSearchField":false,"hideVersionName":true}
```
## Anatomy
Search includes a search bar and a container for suggestions and results. The container is empty by default. Use the list component to add content. In the divided (baseline) style, a divider separates the search bar and results.
![image] 6 elements of search.
_- Search bar container

- Leading icon

- Supporting text

- Trailing icon and avatar (optional)

- Input text

- Container for search suggestions or results_
### Examples
- With avatar

- With one trailing icon button

- With two trailing icon buttons

- With trailing icon button and avatar
![image] 4 search bars with different trailing elements.
## Color
Color values are implemented through design tokens. For designers, this means working with color values that correspond with tokens. In implementation, a color value will be a token that references a value.
### Full-screen layout

## States
States are visual representations used to communicate the status of a component or an interactive element. In [focused search](/m3/pages/search/guidelines#a9b2df31-8561-4326-82cd-41ed6532b765), individual elements maintain their own interaction states. [Learn more about interaction states](/m3/pages/interaction-states/overview)
### Search bar

## §Guidelines

![image] A mobile UI search with hinted text “Search recipes”, “Mexican dishes” is entered, and a list of recipe results appear.
_When focused, a search bar can show a list of search suggestions. As text is entered, search results appear._
## Usage
Search helps people find information quickly.

Use search for products with many items to manage, such as files or messages.
![image] Mobile UI shows a search bar at the top of a message inbox.
_Search helps people find information in large inboxes like messages or emails_
### Different ways to search
The search entry point is dependent on a product’s needs, and should be easy to find:
- Search bar: Use to search contents in a specific view, like **Search your messages**

- Search app bar: Use this app bar variant when search is the primary, global function

- Search icon button: Use when search is a secondary action or not the main focus
![image] A mobile app with a search bar below the page title.
_Add a **search bar** below a title to search specific content_
![image] A mobile app with a search app bar.
_For global search, use a persistent **search app bar**, integrated into an app bar_
![image] A mobile app with a magnifying glass icon on the leading side of the app bar.
_Use a **search** **icon button** when search is a secondary action_
### Focused search
When a search entry point is selected, it opens focused search.  
- Search suggestions can appear before text is entered

- Search results can show as someone is typing or after a search is executed

- Individual elements maintain their own interaction states when search is focused

[More on search states](/m3/pages/search/specs#65c58b10-4569-43d6-9c11-64a5b02f3099)
![image] Focused search with a list of suggestions on a mobile screen.
_When focused, a search bar expands to show search suggestions or results in a list_
If search is the primary action, focused search can be a standalone destination reached from a navigation bar.
![image] Focused search on a mobile screen with a list of suggested contacts.
_Focused search can be a standalone destination, reached by selecting an item in a navigation bar_
### Search suggestions & results
Search suggestions and results both appear in a list component by default.

To help people find information quickly, consider adding variety and context, such as:
- Leading icons related to suggestions

- Category labels, like **Recent**, **Contacts**, or **Suggestions**

- Avatars or other high-priority items

- Filter chips to narrow down results
![image] Search with suggestions organized in a column, ending with a row of 5 contact avatars with names.
_Include high-priority items like avatars in search suggestions or results_
### Gaps
Use gaps to separate a list of suggestions or results into groups.

[More on using gaps in lists](/m3/pages/lists/guidelines#9e96fd72-5bf3-49df-9baf-e025dcca344d)
![image] A gap separates the location and calendar list items from people and pets avatars.
_To separate list items into distinct groups, use a gap_
## Placement
A search bar is typically placed at the top of a screen to remain prominent and accessible. Its location depends on whether search is the primary focus of a product or a secondary action.
![image] Mobile UI with a search bar directly below a Settings headline.
_A search bar can be the primary focus of a page_
![image] Mobile UI with a search bar centered at the top of the screen, above a row of Favorites avatars.
_Search bars should usually be placed at the top of the content_
![image] A photos app with a search icon.
_Search can be a secondary action_
### Focused search layouts
When focused, search suggestions and results appear in a list below the search bar.  

There are two layout options:
- **Docked** opens a list below the search bar, with a scrim covering main content

- **Full-screen** expands to fill the screen

## Anatomy
![image] 6 elements of search.
_- Search bar container

- Leading icon

- Supporting text

- Avatar or trailing icon (optional)

- Input text

- Container for search suggestions or results_
### Search bar container
In the contained style, the search bar container remains the same shape in both the unfocused and focused states. Avoid changing the container behavior.

The container’s margins should be:
- Unfocused: 24dp

- Focused: 12dp

In the divided (baseline) style, a divider separates the search bar and results.
![image] Side-by-side comparison of a search container in unfocused and focused states.
_Search bar containers have persistent, rounded corners_
#### Container color
Search bars use the **surface container high** color role. This role applies when the screen background is white or a tonal **surface** color, ensuring the container has clear contrast.
![image] 2 mobile UIs show search bars on white and tonal backgrounds.
_Search bars use **surface container high** to provide clear contrast_
Avoid using a **surface container high** color on a **surface container** background. This can cause the search bar to blend in, making it difficult for people to find.

To ensure proper contrast, use surface container roles that are more than one step apart.
![image] A “surface container high” search bar on a “surface container” background.
_Using a **surface container high** color on a **surface container** background reduces contrast and may affect accessibility_
### Icons & icon buttons

#### Leading icons
The leading side of a search bar should include either:
- A navigational icon button, such as a menu or arrow

- A non-functional search icon
![image] A search bar on a tablet screen contains a non-functional search icon and a trailing avatar.
_A search bar can contain a non-functional search icon_
#### Trailing icons
A search bar should have one or two trailing icons or icon buttons.

Trailing actions can include:
- Additional modes of searching like voice search

- A separate high-level action such as current location or profile

- An overflow menu

- A decorative search icon
![image] A search bar with 2 trailing icon buttons: a microphone and an overflow menu.
_Use a maximum of two trailing icons_
![image] A search bar with a trailing microphone icon and avatar.
_Combine an avatar with up to one other trailing icon button_
![image] Focused search with a trailing x icon to clear input text.
_Focused search can show an optional **clear** icon to remove input text_
### Text

#### Hinted search text
Provide a short description of the information people can search, like **Search replies** or **Search your messages**.

#### Input text
When a person starts typing, the hinted text is replaced with the input text.
![image] A search bar labeled “Search replies”. “Peanut is entered and “Quick results” appear.
_Hinted search text is replaced when a search query is entered_
## Adaptive design
The search bar position and alignment should scale with the layout, and stay close to the searchable content.

In most cases, a search bar should:
- Stay in its pane and scale in width accordingly

- Internal elements anchor to the left and right as the parent container scales

[More on applying layout](/m3/pages/layout-overview/)
![image] A search bar keeps its layout region and scales with different window sizes and layouts.
_Keep the search bar close to the content a person can search_
### Focused search
When focused, search can switch between showing suggestions or results in a:
- **Docked layout**: Best for medium and expanded windows

- **Full-screen layout**: Default for compact breakpoints

[More on search layouts](/m3/pages/search/specs#fc12e839-f356-4f48-9bd5-0ed210565bfe)
![image] Search suggestions in docked and full screen layouts.
_- A docked layout on a large screen

- A full-screen layout, the default for compact screens_
Search suggestions or results should swap from full-screen in compact windows to docked in larger breakpoints.
![image] Animation shows search suggestions adapting from full-screen on mobile to a docked layout as the window size increases.
_Search suggestions and results should adapt to fit different window sizes_
## Behavior
### Focused search
When a search bar is selected, search becomes focused and can:
- Show historical suggestions before typing

- Show suggestions or results as someone is typing

- Wait to show suggestions or results until a search is queried 

The **back** icon releases focus, dismisses any suggestions or results, and returns the search bar to its original state.
![image] When a search bar is tapped, it becomes focused, and suggestions appear in a list.
_When focused, a list of search suggestions can appear_
![image] A person searches a photo app. The back icon returns the search bar to its original state.
_Focus is released when the back icon is selected_
### Scroll
Depending on needs, a search bar can:
- Scroll away with content, then reappear when a person begins scrolling up

- Remain fixed at the top of the screen
![image] Scrolling up hides the search bar. It reappears when scrolling down.
_A search bar can scroll up with content, then reappear when a person scrolls down_
### Search results
To execute a search, a person can:
- Type a query and press **Enter**

- Select a suggestion or result without querying a search

Search results appear in a list below the bar, and scroll beneath the bar.   

For accessibility, focused search needs a clear status indicator that it’s searching content, like a search icon or **Results** label. [More on search accessibility](/m3/pages/search/accessibility/)
![image] “Peanut” is the entered search query and the first suggestion in the list.
_Show search results in a compact, organized list, with an indicator like **Quick results**_
When search results are queried, the input text should remain visible, but not in focus.
![image] “Pla” is entered into the search bar, “Plants” is suggested and selected.
_Search suggestions and results display in a list, and the input text remains visible_
### Predictive back
On Android, [predictive back](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/docs/foundations/PredictiveBack.md) allows a person to swipe left or right on search. 
- Search detaches from the screen edge to signal the full-screen layout will minimize

- The previous screen is revealed in a preview

[More predictive back design guidance](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/custom-back/predictive-back-gesture)
![image] Swiping left on search causes the Android screen to scale left.
_The search surface and content scale back in the direction of the gesture_

## §Accessibility

## Use cases
People should be able to use assistive technology to:
- Navigate to and focus on a search bar

- View the hinted search text or persistent label

- Input text and complete a search

- Interact with a list of search suggestions and results

- Clear the input text
## Interaction & style
### Autosuggest
When search suggestions and results appear, the screen reader must announce the change. This lets people know list items are available for selection.
![image] Hinted search text and autocomplete results on a mobile screen.
_Autocomplete results should be announced by the screen reader_
## Initial focus
Initial focus lands on the first interactive element. This is often a leading icon button or text field. A leading icon button usually activates search directly or opens a navigation component.
![image] Search bar with a focused leading icon.
_Initial focus can land on a leading icon_
![image] Search bar with no leading icon. The text field is focused.
_If there’s no leading icon, focus lands on the text field_
## Keyboard navigation
| | **Keys**
 | **Actions**

| **Tab** or **Shift** + **Tab**
 | Navigate between interactive elements

| **Space** or **Enter**
 | Activate the search text field for input

| **Arrows**
 | Navigate between search result items
## Labeling elements
The hinted search text should be used as the accessibility label describing the search bar.  

The role for the input field should be:
- Android: **Text field**

- iOS: **Search field**
![image] Search bar with “Label: Search messages” and “Role: Text field”.
_The accessibility label should match the hinted search text_
Leading and trailing icon buttons should be labeled according to their [accessibility guidance](/m3/pages/icon-buttons/accessibility).
![image] A search bar with accessibility labels for its leading icon button and trailing avatar.
_Use icon labels for icon buttons_
Search suggestions and results use the list component. Screen readers automatically announce the results as a list.

For accessibility labels, follow the [list accessibility guidelines](/m3/pages/lists/accessibility).
