slug: checkbox · updated: 2026-08-12 · source: m3.material.io

## §Overview

- Use checkboxes (instead of switches or radio buttons) if multiple options can be selected from a list
- Label should be scannable
- Selected items are more prominent than unselected items

## Color
Color values are implemented through design tokens. For design, this means working with color values that correspond with tokens. For implementation, a color value will be a token that references a value. [Learn more about design tokens](/m3/pages/design-tokens/overview)

### Adjacent text label color
Use the color role **on surface** for adjacent text labels. This remains the same even if interacting with the label or component.

## States
States are visual representations used to communicate the status of a component or interactive element. [Learn more about interaction states](/m3/pages/interaction-states/overview)

## §Guidelines

## Usage
Use checkboxes to: 
- Select one or more options from a list
- Present a list containing sub-selections
- Turn an item on or off in a desktop environment
- Visually group similar options together

_Checkboxes select multiple, related options_
Checkboxes should be used instead of switches if multiple, related options can be selected from a list. Checkboxes visually group similar items effectively and take up less space than switches.

_Checkboxes let users select one or more options from a list. A parent checkbox allows for easy selection or deselection of all items._

_If a list consists of multiple options, don't use switches. Instead, use checkboxes. Checkboxes imply the items are related, and take up less visual space._
### Alternate selection controls
Checkboxes, radio buttons, and switches are the three main  selection controls. They all help people make choices, like selecting options or switching settings on or off.
- Use checkboxes to select multiple related options in a list.

- Use radio buttons to select a single option in a list.

- Use switches to select standalone or more verbose options in a list, like settings.

## Anatomy

## Responsive layout
In expanded breakpoints, placing checkboxes within a contained region such as a side sheet can help group related controls and available actions.

## Behavior
Multiple checkboxes in a list can be selected.

_Selecting multiple items in a list using checkboxes_
Checkboxes can have a parent-child relationship with other checkboxes.
- When the parent checkbox is checked, all child checkboxes are checked
- If a parent checkbox is unchecked, all child checkboxes are unchecked
- If some, but not all, child checkboxes are checked, the parent checkbox becomes an indeterminate checkbox. Checking an indeterminate checkbox checks all child items.
![image] Checking parent checkbox also checks child items. Unchecking one child item makes parent indeterminate.
_Use a parent checkbox to make it more efficient to select many items_
When selected, a checkbox clearly and instantly communicates its selected state.
If used to turn something on or off, the action should be immediately executed.

## §Accessibility

## Use cases
People should be able to use assistive technology to:
- Navigate to a checkbox   

- Toggle the checkbox on and off

- Get appropriate feedback based on input type documented under [Interaction & style](/m3/pages/checkbox/accessibility#6a2f55e5-2fa0-4204-b6d1-62362dda89c7)
## Interaction & style
Users should be able to select either the text label or the checkbox to select an option.
![image] In a list, checkboxes for 2 items are selected via their text labels.
_A checkbox selected via the text label_
The parent checkbox has three states: selected, unselected, and indeterminate. 
Checkboxes can be selected or unselected regardless of the state of the other checkboxes in a group. 
If some, but not all, child checkboxes are checked, the parent checkbox becomes indeterminate. Selecting an indeterminate parent checkbox will check all of its child checkboxes.
![image] In a list, a child checkbox for 1 item is selected and the parent checkbox is in indeterminate state.

## Avoid applying density by default
Don't apply density to checkboxes by default — this lowers their targets below our best practice of 48x48 CSS pixels. Instead, give people a way to choose a higher density, like selecting a denser layout or changing the theme.
To ensure that this density setting can be easily reverted when it's active, keep all the targets to change it at minimum 48x48 CSS pixels each.
## Keyboard navigation
| | Keys | Actions
| **Tab** | Moves focus to enabled chip or chip group
| **Space** or **Enter** | Activates, selects, or deselects the focused chip
| **Backspace** or **Delete** | Removes currently focused input chip
| **Arrows** | Moves focus between chips
## Labeling elements
If the UI text is correctly linked to the checkbox, assistive tech (such as a screen reader) will read the UI text followed by the component’s role.
The accessibility label for an individual checkbox is typically the same as its adjacent text label.
