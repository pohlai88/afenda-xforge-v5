## §Guidelines

_Sliders can adjust values in real time, such as image attributes_
## Usage
Sliders are used to select values along a track. They’re ideal for adjusting settings such as volume and brightness, or changing the intensity of image filters.

Sliders can use icons or labels to represent a numeric or relative scale.
![image] Sound settings screen with continuous sliders labeled call volume and alarm volume.
_Use sliders to pick a value from a range, like volume loudness_
Changes made with sliders must take effect immediately, so people can understand the effects of their selection as they're moving the slider.
![image] The brightness slider changes the screen’s brightness in real time.
_Selection changes are immediate_
There are three different variants of sliders: **standard**, **centered**, and **range:**

Standard sliders select one value from a range of values. Use this when the slider should start from zero or the beginning of a sequence.

_Horizontal standard slider_
![image] Vertical standard slider  with an end stop indicator.
_Vertical standard slider_
Centered sliders select a value from a positive and negative value range. Use this when zero, or the default value, is in the middle of the range.
![image] Horizontal centered slider with a negative value and visible stop indicators at each end.
_Horizontal centered slider_
![image] Vertical centered slider with a negative value and visible stop indicators at each end.
_Vertical centered slider_
Range sliders select two values on one slider to create a range. Use this when defining a minimum and maximum value.

Avoid using range sliders vertically, as this can add too much cognitive load. People are used to most sliders being horizontal.

_Because of the additional cognitive load of a range slider, avoid using it in vertical orientation._

- Inset icon (optional)_
### Track
The track shows the full range of values that can be selected on the slider. It has two sections: active and inactive.
- The **active **section of the track is from the minimum value to the handle. For range sliders, the active track is between the two handles.
- The **inactive** section of the track is from the handle to the maximum value, or outside the two handles of a range slider.
For left-to-right (LTR) languages, the values increase from left to right. For right-to-left (RTL) languages, this is reversed.

### Handle
The handle can be moved along the track to choose a value.

When sliders have two handles, the handles choose the minimum and maximum values in a range.

The handle changes shape to indicate when it’s pressed.
![image] The handle is a vertical line on the current value of the slider. It shrinks in width when selected.

## Configurations
### Value
The value displays the specific value that corresponds with the handle’s placement. 

A value appears when interacting with the corresponding handle. For range sliders, only one value should be shown at a time.

If the value is shown elsewhere, the indicator is not required.
![image] A value of 50 is above a slider handle in the middle of the track.
_A value can appear while the handle is being pressed or dragged_
![image] A value of 75 is above the pressed range slider handle. The unselected slider doesn’t show the value.
_For range sliders, the value only appears on one handle at a time_
Instead of showing the built-in value label, a separate text input field can be added outside of the slider. If this is added, the slider and value in this text field should automatically update to match each other.
Make sure people can tab to the text field directly after the slider.

_Use **Tab** to navigate to values that are shown outside the slider, like a text input field_
### Stop indicators
Stop indicators show which predetermined values can be chosen on the slider. The slider handle snaps to the closest stop. 

Avoid having too many stop indicators on a slider, because it can become visually crowded and difficult to adjust the value.

All sliders have stops at the end of the inactive track to ensure at least a 3:1 contrast with the background. If the inactive track has this level of contrast already, the end stops can be removed.
![image] Stop indicators are equally spaced out on a slider.
_Stop indicators show each available value on a slider_
Icons or text can be added outside the slider to indicate the range of values and make the slider more accessible. This can be used instead of a stop indicator.

_Plus and minus icons, or text, can be added to the left and right of the slider_
### Orientation
Sliders can be oriented either horizontally or vertically, depending on what is best for your use case.

### Inset icon
Standard sliders that are M, L, or XL can include an icon within the track. This icon should illustrate what the slider controls. Avoid adding inset icons to XS or S sliders.

When there’s not enough space for the icon on the active track, like at a low value, the icon moves to the inactive track.

Consider swapping which icon is displayed at zero, like a volume icon becoming a mute icon.

_Don’t use an inset icon with sliders that have track thicknesses under 40dp_
Don’t use inset icons on centered or range sliders. It makes it unclear where the start of the slider is.

### Size
Sliders come in different sizes: XS, S, M, L, and XL. Use larger sizes to increase the targets and provide a larger visual emphasis.

The active and inactive tracks should always be the same size.
![image] 5 sizes of sliders.
_- XS: 16dp
- S: 24dp
- M: 40dp
- L: 56dp
- XL: 96dp_
XL sliders should be reserved for hero moments, where the slider itself is the most important element on the page.

_XL sliders should be the focus of the page_
## Behaviors
### Select & drag
Select a value by dragging the handle.
![image] Slider handle moves smoothly. The value increases and decreases by single digits.
_**Standard slider**: The handle drags smoothly_
![image] Slider handle snaps to the nearest multiple of 10 when moved.
_**Slider with stop indicators:** The handle snaps to the closest stop indicator while dragged_
### Select jump

### Select & arrow
Select a value using the keyboard.

**Tab:** Focus lands on handle 

**Arrows: **Selected value increases or decreases by one value or stop indicator

**Space & arrows:** Selected value increases or decreases by a larger interval or stop indicator
![image] Tab selects the slider, and arrow keys move the value by 1.

## §Accessibility

## Use cases
People should be able to do the following using assistive technology:
- Navigate to a slider 
- Select a range by controlling a handle along a track
- Get appropriate feedback based on input type
## Interaction & style
The slider handle shrinks in width and the value appears to provide a visual cue to the user that the handle is being pressed.
**Touch**
When tapped or dragged, the handle width shrinks to provide interaction feedback, and the value appears.
**Cursor**
When hovered, the cursor changes. When clicked and dragged, the handle width shrinks, and the value appears.
![image] Dragging a slider using a mouse cursor and by touch. Handle width shrinks when dragged.
_The slider handle changes width during interaction_
### Focus and navigation
Initial focus lands directly on the handle, since it’s the primary interactive element of the slider.
The slider value can then be adjusted using the arrow keys or other keyboard navigation options.
![image] Using keyboard navigation on a slider. Tab to the handle, and use arrow keys to change the value.
_Use arrow keys to change the slider value_
## Color contrast
Use visual anchors so the end of the slider’s inactive track has at least 3:1 contrast with the background. The stop indicator makes the end easily visible on most backgrounds.
![image] The inactive track has contrast below 3:1 with the background. The stop indicator is above 3:1. Slider is accessible.
_A stop indicator on the inactive track makes it easier to identify the end of the slider on a low-contrast background_
Alternatively, icons or other elements that have a 3:1 contrast with the background can be used to indicate the ends of the slider’s inactive track.
![image] The inactive track has contrast ratio below 3:1 with the background. The icon is above 3:1. The slider is accessible.
_Icons make it easier to identify the ends of the slider on a low-contrast background_

## Labeling elements
The accessibility label for a slider is typically the same as the slider's adjacent text label. It should have the **slider** role.
![image] Annotated aria tags of a slider.
_A slider’s accessibility label should match the adjacent UI text_
If the UI text is correctly linked to the slider, assistive tech (such as a screenreader) will read the UI text followed by the component’s role.
